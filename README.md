## Documentation


### Development:

Reindeer built on a top of [vert.x](https://vertx.io/) and uses [gradle](https://gradle.org/) as a build tool. In order to get started, you need to clone the repository and create a config file.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/silverbackhq/Reindeer.git
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Then define your custom configs

```env
APP_NAME=Reindeer
APP_KEY=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost
APP_PORT=8888

APP_AUTH_TOKEN=

DB_CONNECTION=h2
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=/path/to/db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=secret

APP_TIMEZONE=UTC
APP_LANGUAGE=en-us

APP_LOGGING_HANDLERS=console
APP_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug
APP_LOGGING_FORMAT={date} [{level}] {class}.{method}() {message}

REINDEER_LOAD_FROM=config
```

And then migrate & run the application.

```bash
# Provide the path to .env file & Run the app
$ make ARGS="-Denv=/path/to/.env" run
```

Whenever you do changes, please make sure to run the following commands locally:

```bash
# to make sure unit and quality testing passed.
$ make ci

# to format the new code changes.
$ make format

# To list all commands
$ make
```
